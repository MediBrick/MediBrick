Pressure in vessel type

## Cardiac Pressure

- systolic > 140 mmHg 0.2 bar
- abnormal systolic >= 180 mmHg 0.25 bar
- diastolic 60-80 mmHg minimum: 0.05 bar

For a differential pressure sensor to measure blood pressure we need to be able to measure at least: 200 mm Hg

For absolute pressure we would need to add 1033 mbar as max atmospheric pressure at see level: 975 mm Hg

| Pressure | mm Hg | PSI  | bar  | cm H2O | kPa |
| ---      | ---   | ---  | ---  | ---       | --- |
| gage     | 200   | 3.9  | 0.27 | 270       |  27
| absolute | 975   | 18.8 | 1.3  | 1330      | 130


## Pulmonary Pressure (lung)

- normal +/- 1 to 2 cm H2O
- forced inhale -60 to -100 cm H2O
- forced exhale 80 to 120 cm H2O
- cough  200-300 cm H20 brief

For a differential pressure sensor to measure blood pressure we need to be able to measure at least: 200 cm H2O

For absolute pressure we would need to add 1033 mbar as max atmospheric pressure at see level: 975 mm 1250 cm H20

| Pressure | mm Hg | PSI  | bar  | cm H2O | kPa | in H2O |
| ---      | ---   | ---  | ---  | ---    | --- | ---    |
| gage     | 150   | 2.9  | 0.2  | 200    |  20 | 80     |
| absolute | 920   | 18   | 1.22 | 1250   | 123 | |

## Bladder Pressure
- normal < 5 mm Hg
- abnormal 15 mm Hg

## Colon Pressure
- normal at rectum 60-100 mm Hg
- normal at cecum 60-80 mm Hg
