Pressure in vessel type

## Cardiac Pressure

- systolic > 140mmHg  maximum 0.25bar
- abnormal systolic >= 180mmHg
- diastolic 60-80mmHg minimum: 0.05bar

For a differential pressure sensor to measure blood pressure we need to be able to measure at least 200 mm Hg. For absolute pressure we would need to add 1033 mbar as max atmospheric pressure at see level.


| Pressure | mm Hg | PSI  | Bar  | meter H2O | hPa  | kPa |
| ---      | ---   | ---  | ---  | ---       | ---  | --- |
| gage     | 200   | 3.9  | 0.27 | 2.7       | 267  | 27
| gage     | 300   | 5.8  | 0.4  | 4         | 400  | 40
| absolute | 975   | 18.8 | 1.3  | 13.3      | 1300 | 130
| absolute | 1074  | 20.8 | 1.4  | 14.6      | 1433 | 143

## Pulmonary Pressure (lung)

- normal 11-20 mm Hg
- maximum inhale -124cm H2O
- maximum exhale +230cm H2O
- ventilation 2-3kPa

## Bladder Pressure
- normal < 5mm Hg
- abnormal 15 mm Hg

## Colon Pressure
- normal at rectum 60-100mmHg
- normal at cecum 60-80mmHg
